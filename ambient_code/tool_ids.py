"""Reversible, stateless tool-call id codec.

The OpenAI chat-completions convention and the Anthropic Messages convention use
different tool-call id grammars: OpenAI-style ids such as `functions.Read:0` contain
`.` and `:`, while Anthropic's `tool_use.id` accepts `^[A-Za-z0-9_-]+$`. The bridge
speaks the OpenAI API upstream and the Anthropic API to Claude Code, so it owns the
id Claude Code sees. This codec maps each id into the Anthropic grammar and back
**reversibly**, statelessly (no session map — the
bridge is stateless, Claude Code can replay/resume history, and a restarted bridge
must still decode an id it emitted earlier):

  encode(openai_id) -> anthropic-legal id
  decode(anthropic_id) -> the exact original openai_id

Correctness comes from applying `decode` UNIFORMLY to both the assistant `tool_use.id`
and the following `tool_result.tool_use_id`, so the replayed OpenAI request is
internally consistent regardless of the original id shape. `decode(encode(x)) == x`
for every encodable non-empty x. Already-legal ids pass through unchanged
(length-optimal). Everything else is `amb1_` + base64url(MAGIC + utf8(id)); the MAGIC
marker gives provenance (a reserved-prefix id that does NOT carry MAGIC is not ours →
fail CLOSED, never a wrong guess, never hashed/truncated).

Not defended: a byte-mutation of one of OUR ids that still carries MAGIC and stays
canonical would decode to a different original. That does not occur here — the only
transport is Claude Code, which echoes `tool_use.id` VERBATIM in the next
`tool_result`; it never mutates ids. A MAC would close even that at a length cost we
don't need.
