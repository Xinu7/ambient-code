"""Pure reliability decisions for the Ambient bridge — no sockets, no secrets.

Reliability decisions distilled from measured model behavior, so a Claude Code session
runs smoothly over any model Ambient serves. This module
operates on NON-streamed OpenAI `chat.completion` dicts and keys every decision off
per-model numbers the CALLER supplies (floor + real context window), so it stays
correct for any model Ambient serves now or later.

Every function is pure and immutable: none mutate their argument; rewrites return a
new dict. `ambient_code.server` composes these over a real socket.

Signatures are catalog-FREE (take plain ints) so this module has zero dependency on
either an external `catalog` or bin/ambient's `model_profile`; the caller derives
the numbers from `model_profile()` and passes them in.
